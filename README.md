# Speck implementation in C for 8-bit platforms

This implementation of Speck only considers block and key of the same sizes because minimum code size was needed.

This code was developed for the final project of Computer Engineering in the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo - 2015.

## Project structure

/main.c - test for the Speck cipher (128 bits block and key size)

/Speck.c - implementation

/Speck.h - header with block and key sizes definitionl
